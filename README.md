## Free Learning PacktPublishing script

**packtPublishingFreeEbook.py** - script that automatically grabs and download a daily free eBook from https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning
  You can use it also to download the already claimed eBooks from your account https://www.packtpub.com/account/my-ebooks

The script uses [anti-captcha.com](https://anti-captcha.com/) service to bypass the Recaptcha captcha to function fully automatically. Anticaptcha.com employs people to solve captcha test use whether or not the user is human. The service costs about $ 2 per thousand captcha test, allowing you to operate for a few dollars over the years.

### GOOGLE_DRIVE_API Setup:
Full info about the Google Drive python API can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/python)  

1. Turn on the Drive API  
  - Use [this wizard](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive) to create or select a project in the Google Developers Console and automatically turn on the API. Click Continue, then Go to credentials.
  - On the *Add credentials to your project page*, click the *Cancel* button.
  - At the top of the page, select the OAuth consent screen tab. Select an Email address, enter a *Product name* if not already set, and click the Save button.
  - Select the Credentials tab, click the Create credentials button and select *OAuth client ID*.
  - Select the application type *Other*, enter the name *"GoogleDriveManager"*, and click the Create button.
  - Click *OK* to dismiss the resulting dialog.
  - Click the file_download (Download JSON) button to the right of the client ID.
  - Move this file to your working directory and rename it *"client_secret.json"*

2. Install the Google Client Library
  - Run the following command to install the library using pip:
  ```
  pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client  or pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client-py3
  ``` 

3. Create credentials folder:
  - Simply, just fire up the script with *-sgd* argument; During first launch you will see a prompt in your browser asking for permissions, click then *allow*
  ```
  python packtPublishingFreeEbook.py -sgd
  ```  
  - Or if you're unable to launch browser locally (e.g. you're connecting through SSH without X11 forwarding) use this command once, follow instructions and give permission and later you can use normal command (without *--noauth_local_webserver*).
  ```
  python packtPublishingFreeEbook.py -sgd --noauth_local_webserver
  ```  
4. Already done!
  - Run the same command as above to claim and upload the eBook to Google Drive.
